I build distributed systems and platform infrastructure that scale with teams and traffic. Over 18 years, I've architected data pipelines processing billions of events, built custom engines supporting thousands of concurrent users, and led technical teams that delivered measurable business impact. I solve the complex infrastructure problems so teams can focus on building features.
