I build distributed systems and platform infrastructure that scale with
teams and traffic. Over 18 years, I've architected data pipelines
processing billions of events, built custom engines supporting thousands
of concurrent users, and led technical teams that delivered measurable
business impact. I solve the complex infrastructure problems so teams
can focus on building features.
