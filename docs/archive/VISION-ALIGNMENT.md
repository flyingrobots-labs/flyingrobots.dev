# Vision Alignment: FlyingRobots.dev

## Purpose of This Document

This document clarifies the shared vision for FlyingRobots.dev to ensure we're aligned on goals, scope, and approach. It addresses potential areas of misalignment and establishes clear boundaries for the project.

## Shared Vision Points ✅

### 1. **Portfolio Excellence**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Current Demo] --> B[Architecture Showcase]
    B --> C[Senior-Level Portfolio]
    C --> D[Dream Job]
    
    style C fill:#9f9
```

**We Agree**: This is primarily a portfolio piece that demonstrates senior engineering skills, not a game or product.

### 2. **Quality Over Quantity**
- Production-ready code quality
- 95%+ test coverage
- Professional documentation
- Clean architecture

**We Agree**: Every feature should be polished and demonstrate best practices.

### 3. **Pragmatic Architecture**
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Our Approach"
        A[Start Simple] --> B[Refactor Incrementally]
        B --> C[Hybrid Architecture]
        C --> D[Extensible Platform]
    end
    
    subgraph "Not Our Approach"
        X[Overengineer Day 1]
        Y[Pure Dogma]
        Z[Academic Exercise]
    end
    
    style C fill:#9f9
    style X fill:#f99
```

**We Agree**: Use the right tool for the job - SOLID where it makes sense, ECS patterns where they add value.

## Potential Misalignment Areas 🤔

### 1. **Scope Creep**

**Concern**: "Should we add multiplayer/AI/procedural generation/etc?"

**Alignment**: 
- These are **future possibilities**, not current goals
- Core features first, then extensibility
- Plugin architecture enables future features without bloating core

```mermaid
graph LR
    Core[Core Features<br/>MVP] --> Ext[Extensible<br/>Architecture]
    Ext --> Future[Future<br/>Possibilities]
    
    style Core fill:#9f9
    style Future fill:#ffd
```

### 2. **Complexity Level**

**Concern**: "Is the hybrid architecture too complex?"

**Alignment**:
- Complexity should serve the portfolio goal
- Must remain understandable to other engineers
- Documentation explains the "why" behind decisions

### 3. **Timeline Expectations**

**Concern**: "320-420 hours seems like a lot"

**Alignment**:
- Quality takes time
- Phased approach delivers value incrementally
- Can stop at any phase with portfolio-worthy result

## What This Project IS ✅

1. **A Living Resume**
   - Interactive demonstration of skills
   - Not just code, but architectural thinking
   - Shows progression and learning

2. **An Architecture Playground**
   - Demonstrates SOLID principles
   - Shows ECS understanding
   - Proves pragmatic decision-making

3. **A Teaching Tool**
   - Well-documented decisions
   - Clear code with explanations
   - Example of professional development

4. **A Technical Showcase**
   - Three.js mastery
   - Performance optimization
   - Testing excellence
   - CI/CD implementation

## What This Project IS NOT ❌

1. **Not a Game Engine**
   - No level editor needed
   - No complex gameplay systems
   - No save/load unless demonstrating patterns

2. **Not a Research Project**
   - Use proven technologies
   - Avoid experimental approaches
   - Focus on employable skills

3. **Not a Product**
   - No monetization needed
   - No user accounts
   - No backend unless demonstrating skills

4. **Not an Art Project**
   - Visuals serve the interaction
   - Focus on code quality over graphics
   - Clean aesthetics, not bleeding edge
