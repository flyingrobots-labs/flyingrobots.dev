# SOLID Principles Violations Analysis

## Overview
This analysis examines the current architecture of the Three.js cyberpunk portfolio application for violations of SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion).

## 1. src/main.js - Application Entry Point

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) Violations
- **Multiple Responsibilities**: This file handles:
  - CSS imports and styling
  - Window-level DOM manipulation functions
  - Section collapsing functionality
  - Achievement list interactivity
  - Terminal initialization and toggling
  - Event listener setup
  - Error handling

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) Violations
- **Direct Dependencies**: 
  - Directly imports and depends on concrete implementations (`scene.js`, `Terminal.js`)
  - Creates terminal instance directly instead of through abstraction
  - Tightly coupled to `sceneManager` from `scene.js`

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP) Violations
- **Hard-coded Functions**: Window-level functions are defined inline, making extension difficult
- **No Abstraction**: Direct manipulation of DOM elements without abstraction layer

## 2. src/scene.js - Main Scene Management

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) Violations - SEVERE
This file has numerous responsibilities:
- Three.js scene setup and management
- Camera controls and spring physics
- Keyboard/mouse input handling
- Lighting setup and management
- Tracer particle effects
- Physics world integration
- Shape management integration
- AABB helper visualization
- Physics wireframe visualization
- Post-processing setup
- Animation loop
- Window resize handling
- Scroll handling
- Camera instruction UI
- Scene manager API

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP) Violations
- **Hard-coded Shape Types**: Shape creation is hard-coded in `createInitialShapes()`
- **Fixed Lighting Configuration**: Lighting setup is hard-coded
- **Inline Helper Functions**: Many helper functions defined inline rather than extensible

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) Violations
- **Concrete Dependencies**:
  - Direct imports of all component modules
  - Creates instances directly (`PhysicsWorld`, `InstancedShapeManager`)
  - No dependency injection

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) Violations
- **Large Public API**: The `sceneManager` export exposes many methods that could be segregated

## 3. src/physics/PhysicsWorld.js - Physics Engine

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) Violations
- **Multiple Responsibilities**:
  - Physics body class definitions
  - Physics simulation
  - Collision detection
  - Force calculations
  - Boundary constraints
  - Body creation factory

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP) Violations
- **Hard-coded Physics Types**: Body types are hard-coded with switch statements
- **Fixed Physics Parameters**: Gravity, damping, bounds are hard-coded

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) Issues
- **Inconsistent Abstractions**: Some bodies (Cone, Cylinder) extend BoxBody but represent different shapes
- **Torus extends Sphere**: A torus is approximated as a sphere, which may violate expected behavior

## 4. src/components/InstancedShapes.js - Rendering System

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) Violations
- **Multiple Responsibilities**:
  - Geometry management
  - Material creation
  - Instance management
  - Physics-to-visual synchronization
  - Color management
  - Scale calculations
  - Bounding box helper creation

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) Violations
- **Tight Coupling**: Directly coupled to physics world implementation
- **Hard-coded Dependencies**: Direct Three.js dependencies without abstraction

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP) Violations
- **Hard-coded Shape Types**: Geometries are defined in a static object
- **Fixed Color Palette**: Colors are hard-coded

## 5. src/components/interactive/Terminal.js - Terminal Interface

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) Violations - SEVERE
This class handles:
- Terminal UI creation
- Command parsing and execution
- History management
- Autocomplete functionality
- Event handling
- Output formatting
- FPS monitoring
- Matrix effects
- Glitch effects
- All command implementations
- UI toggling for the entire application

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP) Violations
- **Hard-coded Commands**: All commands are defined inline in `initializeCommands()`
- **No Command Extension**: Cannot add new commands without modifying the class

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) Violations
- **Monolithic Interface**: Single class handles all terminal functionality
- **No Separation of Concerns**: UI, logic, and effects all in one class

## Key Architectural Issues Summary

### 1. **Tight Coupling**
- Components directly instantiate and depend on each other
- No dependency injection or inversion of control
- Hard to test in isolation

### 2. **God Objects**
- `scene.js` acts as a god object managing too many concerns
- `Terminal.js` handles all terminal-related functionality

### 3. **Lack of Abstractions**
- No interfaces or abstract classes
- Direct dependencies on concrete implementations
- Hard-coded types and configurations

### 4. **Poor Separation of Concerns**
- Business logic mixed with UI code
- Physics mixed with rendering
- Input handling mixed with scene management

### 5. **Extensibility Issues**
- Cannot easily add new shape types
- Cannot extend commands without modifying source
- Cannot swap implementations (e.g., different physics engines)

### 6. **Testability Problems**
- Direct DOM manipulation
- Global state and side effects
- No dependency injection for mocking

## Recommendations for Refactoring

1. **Extract Interfaces**: Define clear interfaces for physics, rendering, and input
2. **Implement Dependency Injection**: Use constructor injection for dependencies
3. **Separate Concerns**: Break up god objects into focused, single-purpose classes
4. **Use Factory Pattern**: For shape and body creation
5. **Implement Command Pattern**: For terminal commands
6. **Extract Configuration**: Move hard-coded values to configuration objects
7. **Create Abstraction Layers**: Between Three.js, physics, and application logic
8. **Implement Event System**: For decoupling components
